(See Analects 4. on these concepts.) Zigong’s aspiration to the virtue of shu is particularly amusing to Kongzi because Zigong is the most unimaginative and rigid of all the disciples. In Analects 5., for instance, his fastidious adherence to the rites leads Kongzi to dub him a “ritual vessel” of limited capacity, and in Analects 1. he is criticized by Kongzi for being too strict and judgmental with others (i.e., for not moderating his duty-defined demands upon others with understanding). Zigong thus functions in the Analects as an excellent example of how the virtue of loyalty goes awry when not tempered with sympathetic understanding, and this is perhaps why Kongzi singles out Zigong in Analects 1. for his message that “sympathetic understanding” is the one teaching that can serve as a lifelong guide. human nature or the Way of Heaven, but rather tried to focus his disciples’ attention upon the task at hand, acquiring the cultural refinement necessary to become gentlemen.

What is being emphasized in this book is the ease and grace with which the Master embodies the spirit of the rites in every aspect of his life—no matter how trivial—and accords with this spirit in adapting to new and necessarily unforeseeable circumstances. response is both unexpected and moving.

What would you do?” Zengxi stopped strumming his zither, and as the last notes faded away, he set the instrument aside and rose to his feet. “I would choose to do something quite different from any of the other three.” “What harm is there in that?” the Master said. “We are all just talking about our aspirations.” Zengxi then said, “In the third month of Spring, once the Spring garments have been completed, I should like to assemble a company of five or six young men upon the individual needs of his students—a Confucian version of the Buddhist practice of upāya, or “skillful means.” On the distinctive characters of Ran Qiu and Zilu, compare Analects 6. and 9., respectively.KONGZI (CONFUCIUS)  and six or seven boys to go bathe in the Yi River and enjoy the breeze upon the Rain Dance Altar, and then return singing to the Master’s house.” The Master sighed deeply, saying, “I am with Zengxi!” The other three disciples left, but Master Zeng stayed behind.

The point is that true government is effected through the superior Virtue gained by ritual practice, and the task of the gentleman is thus to focus upon self-cultivation and attain a state of joyful harmony with the Way. Such harmony with the Way is exemplified by Zengxi’s musical bent, his reluctance to speak about his aspirations, and the sense of spontaneous joy in the cultivated life conveyed by his answer.

Sima Niu—apparently uninvolved in the revolt or its aftermath—resigned his official post in disgust and emigrated, ending up eventually in Lu, where he presumably had the conversation with Zixia recorded here. His comment that “he alone has no brothers” is thus not meant literally: the point is either that he has no brothers truly worthy of being considered brothers, or that all of his brothers are in exile or in constant danger of losing their lives and therefore as good as dead. Sima Niu is thus bemoaning the fate that has left him effectively without family, an exile from his home state. oceans.KONGZI (CONFUCIUS)  Zigong said, “If sacrificing one of these three things became unavoidable, which would you sacrifice first?” The Master replied, “I would sacrifice the armaments.” Zigong said, “If sacrificing one of the two remaining things became unavoidable, which would you sacrifice next?” The Master replied, “I would sacrifice the food.

Kongzi’s advice is thus very topical. His point is that if everyone would simply concentrate on conscientiously fulfilling their role-specific duties, order would result naturally—there is no need for some special technique or theory of “governing” (cf. Analects 2.).

Reading this passage in light of Analects 1. (“Let the lord be a true lord . . . the fathers true fathers, and the sons true sons.”), it can be seen as a barb against the ruling family of Wei, whose disordered family relations eventually threw the state into chaos. The Duke doted upon his notorious wife, Nanzi (see Analects 6.), whom his resentful son, Prince Kuai Kui, then attempted to kill. This attempt having failed, the son was forced to flee Wei, and the Duke’s grandson, Zhe, subsequently took over the throne upon the Duke’s death. Prince Kuai Kui then returned to Wei with the backing of a foreign army in an attempt to oust his son. CHAPTER ONE Zilu said, “Could you, Master, really be so far off the mark? Why worry about rectifying names?” The Master replied, “How boorish you are, Zilu! When it comes to matters that he does not understand, the gentleman should remain silent. If names are not rectified, speech will not accord [with reality]; when speech does not accord [with reality], things will not be successfully accomplished. When things are not successfully accomplished, ritual practice and music will fail to flourish; when ritual and music fail to flourish, punishments and penalties will miss the mark.

This is something no one can stop.” Xuan said, “Can one such as I care for the people?” records of Huan and Wen. See also Mengzi 4B (below) on honesty.  Mengzi said, “He can.” Xuan said, “How do you know that I can?” Mengzi said, “I heard your attendant Hu He say, The King was sitting up in his hall. There was an ox being led past below. The King saw it and said, ‘Where is the ox going?’ Someone responded, ‘We are about to consecrate a bell with its blood.’ The King said, ‘Spare it. I cannot bear its frightened appearance, like an innocent going to the execution ground.’ Someone responded, ‘So should we abandon the consecrating of the bell?’ The King said, ‘How can that be abandoned? Exchange it for a sheep.’” Mengzi continued, “I do not know if this happened.” Xuan said, “It happened.” Mengzi said, “This feeling is sufficient to be a king. The commoners all thought Your Majesty was being stingy. But I knew that Your Majesty could not bear the frightened appearance of the ox.” The King said, “That is so. There really were commoners like that. Although Qi is a small state, how could I be stingy about one ox? It was just that I could not bear its frightened appearance, like an innocent going to the execution ground. Hence, I exchanged it for a sheep.” Mengzi said, “Let Your Majesty not be surprised at the commoners’ taking you to be stingy. You took a small thing and exchanged it for a big thing. How could they understand? If Your Majesty were pained at its being innocent and going to the execution ground, then what is there to choose between an ox and a sheep?” The King laughed and said, “What was this feeling really?! It’s not the case that I begrudged its value and exchanged it for a sheep. But it makes sense that the commoners would say I was stingy.” Mengzi said, “There is no harm. This is just the way benevolence works. You saw the ox but had not seen the sheep. As for the relation of gentlemen to birds and beasts, if they see them living, they cannot bear to see them die. If they hear their cries, they cannot bear to eat their flesh. Hence, gentlemen keep their distance from the kitchen.” The King was pleased and said, “The Odes say, Another person had the heart, But I measured it. out onto the courtyard below. See the Title Support Page for this volume at www.hackettpublishing.com /rccp-support for an image of such a hall. Cf. Zhuangzi chapter 1 (in chapter 8 of this volume). This describes you. I was the one who did it. I reflected and sought it out, but did not understand my heart. You spoke, and in my heart there was a feeling of compassion. In what way does this heart accord with being a king?” Mengzi said, “Suppose there were someone who reported to Your Majesty, saying, ‘My strength is sufficient to lift five hundred pounds, but not sufficient to lift one feather. My eyesight is sufficient to examine the tip of an autumn hair, but I cannot see a wagon of firewood.’ Would Your Majesty accept that?” Xuan said, “No.” Mengzi said, “In the present case, your kindness is sufficient to reach birds and beasts, but the benefits do not reach the commoners. Why is this case alone different? Hence, not lifting one feather is due to not using one’s strength. Not seeing a wagon of firewood is due to not using one’s eyesight. The commoners not receiving care is due to not using one’s kindness. Hence, Your Majesty’s not being a genuine king is due to not acting; it is not due to not being able.” Xuan said, “What is the difference between concrete cases of not doing and not being able?” Mengzi said, “‘Pick up Mount Tai and leap over the North Sea.’ If you say, ‘I cannot,’ this is truly not being able. ‘Massage the stiff joints of an elderly person.’ If you say, ‘I cannot,’ this is not acting; it is not a case of not being able. So, Your Majesty’s not being a king is not in the category of picking up Mount Tai and leaping over the North Sea. Your Majesty’s not being a king is in the category of massaging the stiff joints of an elderly person. “Treat your elders as elders, and extend it to the elders of others; treat your young ones as young ones, and extend it to the young ones of others; then you can turn the whole world in the palm of your hand. The Odes say, He set an example for his wife, It extended to his brothers, And so, he controlled his family and state. This means that he simply took this feeling and applied it to that. Hence, if one extends one’s kindness, it will be sufficient to care for all within the Four Seas. If one does not extend one’s kindness, one will lack the wherewithal to care for one’s wife and children. That in which the ancients greatly exceeded others was no other than this. They were simply good at extending what they did. In the present case your kindness is sufficient to reach birds and beasts, but the benefits do not  reach the commoners. Why is this case alone different? Weigh, and then you will distinguish the light and the heavy. Measure, and then you will distinguish the long and the short. Things are all like this, the heart most of all. Let Your Majesty measure it. “Perhaps Your Majesty can only be happy in his heart by rallying soldiers, endangering his scholars and ministers, and incurring the resentment of the other lords?” Xuan said, “No. How could I be happy about these things?” Mengzi said, “Could I hear Your Majesty’s greatest desire?” The King smiled and did not speak. Mengzi said, “Is it because your hearty and sweet foods are insufficient for your mouth? Are your light and warm clothes insufficient for your body? Or yet because there are insufficient beautiful and charming sights for your eyes to look at? Are there insufficient melodies for your ears to listen to? Are your servants insufficient to order about in front of you? Your Majesty’s various ministers are sufficient to serve you. Does Your Majesty actually do what you do for these things?!” Xuan said, “No. It is not for the sake of these things.” Mengzi said, “Then Your Majesty’s greatest desire can be known. You desire to govern the land, bring to your court the states of Qin and Chu, oversee the Central States, and dominate the barbarians. By means of such things as you do, to seek such things as you desire, is like climbing a tree in search of a fish.” The King said, “Is it as extreme as that?” Mengzi said, “The danger is greater than that! If one climbs a tree in search of a fish, although one will not get a fish, there will not be any disaster afterward. By means of such things as you do, to seek such things as you desire, if one exhausts the strength of one’s heart in doing it, afterward there must be disaster.” Xuan said, “Could I hear of this?” Mengzi said, “If the people of Zou and the people of Chu fought, who does Your Majesty think would win?” Xuan said, “The people of Chu would win.” Mengzi said, “So the small definitely cannot match the big, the few definitely cannot match the many, the weak definitely cannot match the strong. The region within the seas is nine thousand square li. Qi amounts to one thousand. To take on eight with one, how is this different from Zou matching Chu?! “Simply return to the fundamentals. Suppose Your Majesty were to bestow benevolence in governing. This would cause all under Heaven who serve others to want to take their place in Your Majesty’s court, all those who plow to want to plow in Your Majesty’s uncultivated fields, all merchants to want to place their goods in Your Majesty’s markets, all those who travel to wish to use Your Majesty’s roads. All CHAPTER FOUR under Heaven who wish to complain of their rulers would desire to report to Your Majesty. If it were like this, who could stop it?” The King said, “I am ignorant and unable to undertake this. But I am willing for you, Master, to redirect my resolution, enlighten, and instruct me. Although I am not clever, please let me try.” Mengzi said, “To lack a constant livelihood, yet to have a constant heart—only a scholar is capable of this. As for the people, if they lack a constant livelihood, it follows that they will lack a constant heart. And if one simply fails to have a constant heart, dissipation and evil will not be avoided. When they thereupon sink into crime, to go and punish them is to trap the people. When there are benevolent people in positions of authority, how is it possible to trap the people? For this reason, an enlightened ruler, in regulating the people’s livelihood, must ensure that it is sufficient, on the one hand, to serve one’s father and mother, and on the other hand, to nurture wife and children. In good years, one is always full. In years of famine, one escapes death. Only when the people have a regulated livelihood do they rush toward the good, and thus the people follow the ruler easily. “Nowadays, in regulating the people’s livelihood, on the one hand it is insufficient to serve one’s father and mother, on the other it is insufficient to nurture wife and children. In good years, one is always bitter. In years of famine, one cannot escape death. This is a case in which one fears not having the means to save people from death. How could one have leisure for teaching ritual and righteousness? “If Your Majesty wishes to put benevolent government into effect, then simply return to the fundamentals. Plant every household of five mu with mulberry trees, and fifty-year-olds can wear silk. Let the nurturing of chickens, pigs, and dogs not be neglected, and seventy-year-olds can eat meat. If you do not disturb the seasonal work in each field of one hundred mu, a household with eight mouths to feed need not go hungry. If you are careful about the teachings of the schools, explaining the righteousness of filial piety and fraternal respect, then those with gray hair will not be carrying loads on the roads. For the old to wear silk and eat meat, and the blackhaired people to be neither hungry nor cold, yet for their ruler not to become a king—such a thing has never happened.”"}

King Xuan of Qi said, “Your teachings are excellent!” Mengzi responded, “If Your Majesty regards them as excellent, then why do you not put them into practice?”  The King said, “We have a weakness. We are fond of wealth.” He responded, “In former times, Duke Liu was fond of wealth. The Odes say, He stacked, he stored, He bundled up dried meat and grain, In bags, in sacks, Thinking to gather together and bring glory. His bows and arrows were displayed, With shields, spears, and battle-axes, He commenced his march. Hence, those who stayed at home had loaded granaries, and those who marched had full provisions. Only then could he ‘commence his march.’ If Your Majesty is fond of wealth but allows the common folk to possess wealth, what difficulty is there in being a genuine king?” The King responded, “We have a weakness.

If it were so, it would not be surprising at all if the ruler of Qi were to become a lord protector or a genuine king. If it were like this, would it perturb your heart or not?” Mengzi said, “It would not. My heart has been unperturbed since I was forty.” Gongsun Chou said, “In that case, you, Master, have far surpassed Meng Ben.” Mengzi said, “This is not difficult. Gaozi had an unperturbed heart before I.” Gongsun Chou said, “Is there a way of cultivating an unperturbed heart?” Mengzi said, “There is. As for Bogong You’s cultivation of courage, his body would not shrink, his eyes would not blink. He regarded the least slight from someone like being beaten in the marketplace. Insults he would not tolerate from a common fellow coarsely clad he also would not tolerate from a ruler who could field serpents, and, when traveling by land, did not avoid rhinoceroses and tigers.” Mengzi’s critique of Gaozi, see David S. Nivison, “Philosophical Voluntarism in Fourth-Century China,” in The Ways of Confucianism (Chicago: Open Court Publishing, 1), 1–.

He looked upon running a sword through a ruler who could field ten thousand chariots as like running through a common fellow. He did not treat the various lords with deference. If an insult came his way, he had to return it. “As for Meng Shishe’s cultivation of courage, he said, ‘I look upon defeat the same as victory. To advance only after sizing up one’s enemy, to ponder whether one will achieve victory and only then join battle, this is to be in awe of the opposing armies. How can I be certain of victory? I can only be without fear.’ “Meng Shishe resembled Master Zeng. Bogong You resembled Zixia. Now, as for the courage of the two, I do not really know which was better. Nonetheless, Meng Shishe preserved something important. “Formerly, Master Zeng speaking to Zixiang said, ‘Are you fond of courage? I once heard about great courage from the Master: If I examine myself and am not upright, although I am opposed by a common fellow coarsely clad, would I not be in fear? If I examine myself and am upright, although I am opposed by thousands and tens of thousands, I shall go forward.’ Meng Shishe’s preservation of his qi was still not as good as Master Zeng’s preservation of what is important.” Gongsun Chou said, “I venture to ask whether I could hear about your unperturbed heart, Master, and Gaozi’s unperturbed heart?” Mengzi answered, “Gaozi said, ‘What you do not get from doctrines, do not seek for in your heart. What you do not get from your heart, do not seek for in the qi.’ ‘What you do not get from your heart, do not seek for in the qi,’ is acceptable. ‘What you do not get from doctrines, do not seek for in your heart,’ is unacceptable. “Your resolution is the commander of the qi. Qi is that which fills up the body. When your resolution is fixed somewhere, the qi sets up camp there. Hence, it is said, ‘Maintain your resolution. Do not injure the qi.’” Gongsun Chou asked, “Since you have already said, ‘When your resolution is fixed somewhere, the qi sets up camp there,’ why do you add, ‘Maintain your resolution. Do not injure the qi’?” it may also be Master Zeng paraphrasing the Master’s teaching. our ethical inclinations (Mengzi 2A and 6A). The “resolution” (zhì 志) is not a separate faculty, but is simply the heart directed toward a certain goal or object. Contrast what Zhuangzi suggests about the relationship between what one hears, one’s heart, and the qi in Zhuangzi chapter 4, “The Human Realm” (in chapter 8 of this volume). On qi, see Important Terms in the appendices. CHAPTER FOUR Mengzi said, “When your resolution is unified it moves the qi. When the qi is unified it moves your resolution. Now, stumbling and running have to do with the qi, but nonetheless they perturb one’s heart.” Gongsun Chou said, “I venture to ask wherein you excel, Master.” Mengzi said, “I understand words. I am good at cultivating my floodlike qi.” Gongsun Chou said, “I venture to ask what is meant by ‘floodlike qi.’” Mengzi said, “It is difficult to put into words. It is a qi that is supremely great and supremely unyielding. If one cultivates it with uprightness and does not harm it, it will fill up the space between Heaven and earth. It is a qi that unites righteousness with the Way. Without these, it starves. It is produced by accumulated righteousness. It cannot be obtained by a seizure of righteousness. If some of one’s actions leave one’s heart unsatisfied, it will starve. Consequently, I say that Gaozi never understood righteousness, because he regarded it as external. “One must work at it, but do not aim at it directly. Let the heart not forget, but do not ‘help’ it grow. Do not be like the man from Song. Among the people of the state of Song there was one who, concerned lest his seedlings not grow, pulled on them. Wearily, he returned home, and said to his family, ‘Today I am worn out. I helped the seedlings to grow.’ His son rushed out and looked at it. The seedlings were withered. Those in the world who do not ‘help’ their seedlings to grow are few. Those who abandon them, thinking it will not help, are those who do not weed their seedlings. Those who ‘help’ them grow are those who pull on the seedlings. Not only does this not help, but it even harms them.” Gongsun Chou said, “What is meant by ‘understanding words’?” Mengzi said, “If someone’s expressions are one-sided, I know that by which they are deluded. If someone’s expressions are excessive, I know that by which they are entangled. If someone’s expressions are heretical, I know that by which they are separated from the Way. If someone’s expressions are evasive, I know that by which they are exhausted. When these states grow in the heart, they are harmful in governing. When they are manifested in governing, they are harmful in one’s activities. When sages arise again, they will surely follow what I have said.” Han Feizi chapter 4 (in chapter 1 of this volume). lects 1. (in chapter 1 of this volume), and is a central notion in Xunzi chapter 2, “Undoing Fixation” (in chapter 9 of this volume).MENGZI (MENCIUS)  Gongsun Chou said, “Zai Wo and Zigong were good at rhetoric. Ran Niu, Minzi, and Yan Yuan were good at discussing virtuous actions. Kongzi combined all these excellences, but said, ‘When it comes to rhetoric, I am incapable.’ In that case, are you, Master, already a sage?!” Mengzi said, “Oh, what kind of talk is that?! Long ago, Zigong asked Kongzi, ‘Are you, Master, really a sage?’ Kongzi replied, ‘As for being a sage, I am incapable of that. I study without tiring and teach without wearying.’ Zigong said, ‘To study without tiring is wisdom; to teach without wearying is benevolence. Being benevolent and wise, the Master is certainly already a sage!’ So, to be a sage is not something Kongzi was comfortable with. So how could you ask me that?!” Gongsun Chou said, “Formerly, I heard the following: Zigong, Ziyou, and Zizhang all had one aspect of a sage. Ran Niu, Minzi, and Yan Yuan had all aspects of a sage, but in miniature. I venture to ask in which group you would be comfortable?” Mengzi said, “Leave this topic for now.” Gongsun Chou said, “What about Bo Yi and Yi Yin?” Mengzi said, “Their Ways were different. If he was not his ruler, he would not serve him; if they were not his subjects, he would not direct them; if things were orderly, he would advance; if they were chaotic, he would retreat. This was Bo Yi. Whom do I serve who is not my ruler? Whom do I direct who are not my subjects? If things were orderly, he would advance, and if they were chaotic, he would also advance. This was Yi Yin. When one should take office, he would take office; when one should stop, he would stop; when one should take a long time, he would take a long time; when one should hurry, he would hurry. This was Kongzi. All were sages of ancient times. I have never been able to act like them, but my wish is to learn from Kongzi.” Gongsun Chou asked, “Were Bo Yi and Yi Yin at the same level as Kongzi?” Mengzi said, “No. Since humans were first born there has never been another Kongzi.” Gongsun Chou said, “In that case, were there any similarities?” Mengzi said, “There were. If any became ruler of a territory of a hundred li, he would be able to possess all under Heaven by bringing the various lords to his court. And if any could obtain all under Heaven by performing one unrighteous deed, or killing one innocent person, he would not do it. In these things they are the same.” Gongsun Chou asked, “I venture to ask wherein they differed?” Mengzi said, “Zai Wo, Zigong, and You Ruo had wisdom sufficient to recognize a sage. Even if they exaggerated, they would not have done so to the extent of flattering someone they were fond of. Zai Wo said, ‘In my view of Kongzi, he is far more noble than Yao and Shun!’ Zigong said, ‘He sees their rituals and appreciates their government; he hears their music and appreciates their Virtue; from a hundred generations later, through the succession of a hundred kings, nothing gets away from him. Since humans were first born, there has never been another like the Master.’ You Ruo said, ‘Is it only true of people? The unicorn among beasts, the phoenix among birds, Mount Tai among hills, and rivers and seas among flowing waters, are all of a kind. The sage among people is also of the same kind. Some stand out from this kind; some stick up from the row; since humans were first born, there has never been one who stands out more than Kongzi.’”"}

The former kings had hearts that were not unfeeling toward others, so they had governments that were not unfeeling toward others. If one puts into practice a government that is not unfeeling toward others by means of a heart that is not unfeeling toward others, bringing order to the whole world is in the palm of your hand. “The reason why I say that humans all have hearts that are not unfeeling toward others is this. Suppose someone suddenly saw a child about to fall into a well: everyone in such a situation would have a feeling of alarm and compassion—not because one sought to get in good with the child’s parents, not because one wanted fame among their neighbors and friends, and not because one would dislike the sound of the child’s cries. “From this we can see that if one is without the heart of compassion, one is not a human. If one is without the heart of disdain, one is not a human. If one is without the heart of deference, one is not a human. If one is without the heart of approval and disapproval, one is not a human. The heart of compassion is the sprout of benevolence. The heart of disdain is the sprout of righteousness. The heart of deference is the sprout of propriety.

On Mengzi’s general view of self-cultivation, see Mengzi 7A and 7B. “Propriety” here is lǐ 禮, the character for “ritual” elsewhere. Mengzi is suggesting that an inclination toward ritual activity is innate in us. See Mengzi 3A for a possible illustration of this.MENGZI (MENCIUS)  “People having these four sprouts is like their having four limbs. To have these four sprouts but to say of oneself that one is unable to be virtuous is to steal from oneself. To say that one’s ruler is unable to be virtuous is to steal from one’s ruler. In general, having these four sprouts within oneself, if one knows to fill them all out, it will be like a fire starting up, a spring breaking through! If one can merely fill them out, they will be sufficient to care for all within the Four Seas. If one merely fails to fill them out, they will be insufficient to serve one’s parents.”"}

I wish to receive a homestead and become one of your subjects.” Duke Wen gave him a place. His followers were a few dozen people, all of whom wore coarse clothing and made sandals and mats for a living. Chen Liang’s disciple Chen Xiang and his younger brother Xin carried their plows on their backs and went from Song to Teng, saying, “We have heard that you, My Lord, practice the government of a sage. This is to be a sage. I wish to become the subject of a sage.” Chen Xiang met Xu Xing and was delighted. He completely abandoned his former studies and studied with him instead. Chen Xiang met Mengzi and discoursed on the doctrines of Xu Xing, saying, “The ruler of Teng is truly a worthy ruler. Nonetheless, he has not yet heard the Way.

And when the blacksmith exchanges tools for millet, does this really hurt the farmer?! Why does Xuzi not become a blacksmith, and only get everything from his own in the appendices.MENGZI (MENCIUS)  household to use? Why does he exchange things in such confusion with the various artisans? Why does Xuzi not avoid all this trouble?” Chen said, “The activities of the various artisans inherently cannot be done along with farming.” Mengzi said, “In that case, can governing the world alone be done along with farming? There are the affairs of great people, and the affairs of lesser people. Furthermore, the products of the various artisans are available to each person. If one can make use of them only after one has made them oneself, this will lead the whole world to exhaustion. Hence it is said, ‘Some labor with their hearts; some labor with their physical strength.’ Those who labor with their hearts govern others; those who labor with their physical strength are governed by others. Those who are governed by others feed those others; those who govern others are fed by those others. This is righteousness throughout the world. . . . “It is the way of people that if they are full of food, have warm clothes, and live in comfort, but are without instruction, then they come close to being animals.

Yao said, ‘Encourage them, draw them forward, straighten them, rectify them, help them, make them practice, assist them, make them get it themselves, and then benefit them.’ Since the sage’s anxiousness for his subjects was like this, could he have the free time to farm?” . . . [Chen said,] “If we follow the Way of Xuzi, market prices will never vary, and there will be no artifice in the state. Even if one sends a child to go to the market, no one will cheat him. Cotton cloth or silk cloth of the same length will be of equal price. Bundles of hemp or silk of the same weight will be of equal price. The same amount of any of the five grains will be the same price. Shoes of the same size will be of equal price.” Mengzi said, “It is the essence of things to be unequal. One thing is twice or five times more than another, another ten or a hundred times more, another a thousand or ten thousand times more. If you line them up and identify them, this will bring chaos to the world. If a great shoe and a shoddy shoe are the same price, achievements of the sage-rulers of old in making civilization possible. chapter 8 of this volume). CHAPTER FOUR will anyone make the former?

I will make him upright. “I have heard that Yi Zhi is a Mohist. Mohists, in regulating mourning, take frugality as their Way. Yi Zhi longs to change the world to the Mohist Way. Surely, he honors the Mohist practice because he regards it as right? Nonetheless, Yi Zhi buried his parents lavishly, so he served his parents by means of what he demeans.” Xu Bi told Yi Zhi this. Yi Zhi said, “As for the Way of the Confucians, the ancients tended the people ‘like caring for children.’ What does this saying mean? I take it to mean that love is without distinctions, but it is bestowed beginning with one’s parents.” Xu Bi told Mengzi this. Mengzi said, “Does Yi Zhi truly hold that one’s affection for one’s elder brother’s son is like one’s affection for one’s neighbor’s child? There is only one thing to be gleaned from that saying: when a crawling child is about to fall into a well, it is not the child’s fault. Furthermore, Heaven, in producing the things in the world, causes them to have one source, but Yi Zhi gives them two sources. “Now, in past ages, there were those who did not bury their parents. When their parents died, they took them and abandoned them in a ditch. The next day they passed by them, and foxes were eating them, bugs were sucking on them. Sweat broke out on the survivors’ foreheads. They turned away and did not look. Now, it was not for the sake of others that they sweated. What was inside their hearts broke through to their countenances. So, they went home and, returning (presumably because Mengzi is ill). Cf. Analects 1. (in chapter 1 of this volume).

Mengzi 7A), and () a doctrine of universalization that instructs us to extend this innate feeling so that it applies to everyone equally.MENGZI (MENCIUS)  with baskets and shovels, covered them. If covering them was really right, then when filial children and benevolent people cover their parents, it must also be part of the Way.” Xu Bi told Yi Zhi this.

I venture to ask why?” Mengzi said, “How could I be fond of disputation? I simply have no choice. The people of the world were born long ago, and have alternated between being orderly and chaotic. In the time of Yao, the waters overflowed their courses, inundating the central states. Serpents occupied the land, and the people were unsettled. In low-lying regions, they made nests in trees. On the high ground, they lived in caves. The History says, ‘The deluge warned us.’ ‘The deluge’ refers to the flooding water. Yu was directed to regulate the waters. Yu dredged out the earth and guided the water into the sea, chasing the reptiles into the marshes. The waters flowed out through the channels, and these became the Jiang, Huai, He, and Han rivers. The dangers to people having been eliminated, birds and beasts harmful to humans were destroyed, and only then were humans able to live on the plains. “After Yao and Shun passed away, the Way of the sages decayed. Cruel rulers arose one after another, destroying homes to make ponds, so that the people had nowhere they could rest. They made people abandon the fields so that they could be made into parks, so that the people could not get clothes and food. Evil doctrines and cruel practices also arose. As parks, ponds, and marshes became more numerous, the birds and beasts returned. By the time of Tyrant Zhou, the world was again in great disorder. The Duke of Zhou assisted King Wu in punishing Tyrant Zhou; he attacked the state of Yan, and after three years executed its ruler; he under Important Texts in the appendices. On Yao, Shun, Yu and the other figures mentioned in this and the following paragraph, see under Important Figures in the appendices. and not for the benefit of the people. CHAPTER FOUR drove Feilian to a corner by the sea and terminated him; he eliminated fifty states; he drove tigers, leopards, rhinoceroses, and elephants far off, and the whole world rejoiced. The History says, ‘Splendid indeed were the plans of King Wen! Great indeed were the achievements of King Wu! They assist and instruct us descendants. In all things they are correct, and lack nothing.’ “With the decay of the Way, evil doctrines and cruel actions again arose. Ministers murdering their rulers—this happened. Sons murdering their fathers—this happened. Kongzi was afraid, and composed the Spring and Autumn Annals. The Spring and Autumn Annals is the activity of the Son of Heaven. For this reason, Kongzi said, ‘Those who appreciate me, will it not be because of the Spring and Autumn Annals? Those who blame me, will it not be because of the Spring and Autumn Annals?’ “Once again, a sage-king has not arisen; the various lords are dissipated; pundits engage in contrary wrangling; the doctrines of Yang Zhu and Mozi fill the world. If a doctrine does not lean toward Yang, then it leans toward Mo. Yang is ‘for ourselves.’ This is to not have a ruler. Mo is ‘impartial caring.’ This is to not have a father. To not have a father and to not have a ruler is to be an animal. Gongming Yi said, ‘In your kitchens there is fat meat, and in your stables there are fat horses. Your people look gaunt, and in the wilds are the bodies of those dead of starvation. This is to lead animals to devour people.’ “If the Ways of Yang and Mo do not cease, and the Way of Kongzi is not made evident, then evil doctrines will dupe the people, and obstruct benevolence and righteousness. If benevolence and righteousness are obstructed, that leads animals to devour people. I am afraid that people will begin to devour one another! If we defend the Way of the former sages, fend off Yang Zhu and Mozi, and get rid of specious words, then evil doctrines will be unable to arise. If they arise in one’s heart, they are harmful in one’s activities. If they arise in one’s activities, they are harmful in governing. When sages arise again, they will certainly not differ with what I have said. “Formerly, Yu suppressed the flood, and the world was settled. The Duke of Zhou incorporated the barbarians, drove away ferocious animals, and the common people were at peace. Kongzi completed the Spring and Autumn Annals, and disorderly ministers and brutal sons were afraid. The Odes say, of the activities of the ruler, or that composing it is the prerogative of the ruler. volume). On the philosophy of Yang Zhu, see Mengzi 7A and “Robber Zhi” (in chapter 3 of this volume).MENGZI (MENCIUS)  The barbarians of the west and north, these he chastised. Jing and Shu, these he punished. Thus no one dared to take us on. Those who [act as if they] have no father and no ruler, these the Duke of Zhou chastised. I, too, desire to rectify people’s hearts, to bring to an end evil doctrines, to fend off bad conduct, to get rid of specious words, so as to carry on the work of these three sages. How could I be fond of disputation? I simply have no choice. Anyone who can with words fend off Yang Zhu and Mozi is a disciple of the sages.”"}

Hence, it really is external. It does not come from [how you feel] internally.” Gongduzi was not able to answer. He told Mengzi about it. Mengzi said, “Next time, ask him, ‘Do you respect your uncle? or do you respect your younger brother?’ He will say, ‘I respect my uncle.’ Then you say, ‘When your younger brother is playing the part of the deceased in the sacrifice, then whom do you respect?’ He will say, ‘I respect my younger brother.’ Then you say, ‘What happened to the respect for your uncle?’ He will say, ‘The reason [why my respect changes] has to do with the role my younger brother occupies.’ Then you also say, ‘In the case you asked about in our previous discussion, the reason why my respect changes has to do with the role the fellow villager occupies. Ordinary respect is directed toward my brother, but temporary respect is directed toward the fellow villager.’” Meng Jizi, upon hearing all this, said, “If you respect your uncle, then it is respect. If you respect your younger brother, then it is respect. So, it really is external. It does not come from [how you feel] internally.” Gongduzi said, “On a winter day, one drinks broth. On a summer day, one drinks water. Are drinking and eating also, then, external?”"}
{"philosopher": "Mencius", "work": "Mencius", "book": "Six", "reference": "6A6", "text": "Gongduzi said, “Gaozi says, ‘Human nature is neither good nor not good.’ Some say, ‘Human nature can become good, and it can become not good.’ Therefore, when the sages Wen and Wu arose, the people were fond of goodness. When the tyrants You and Li arose, the people were fond of destructiveness. Some say, ‘There are natures that are good, and there are natures that are not good.’ Therefore, with Yao as ruler, there was Xiang. With the Blind Man as a father, there was  Shun. And with Tyrant Zhou as their nephew, and as their ruler besides, there were Viscount Qi of Wei and Prince Bi Gan. Now, you say that human nature is good. Are all those others, then, wrong?” Mengzi said, “As for their essence, they can become good. This is what I mean by calling their natures good. As for their becoming not good, this is not the fault of their potential. Humans all have the heart of compassion. Humans all have the heart of disdain. Humans all have the heart of respect. Humans all have the heart of approval and disapproval. The heart of compassion is benevolence. The heart of disdain is righteousness. The heart of respect is propriety. The heart of approval and disapproval is wisdom. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are not welded to us externally. We inherently have them. It is simply that we do not reflect upon them. Hence, it is said, ‘Seek it and you will get it. Abandon it and you will lose it.’ Some differ from others by two, five, or countless times—this is because they cannot exhaust their potentials. The Odes say, Heaven gives birth to the teeming people. If there is a thing, there is a norm. This is the constant people cleave to. They are fond of this beautiful Virtue. Kongzi said, ‘The one who composed this ode understood the Way!’ Hence, if there is a thing, there must be a norm. It is this that is the constant people cleave to. Hence, they are fond of this beautiful Virtue.”"}

Although there are some differences, these are due to the richness of the soil, and to unevenness in the rain and in human effort. Hence, in general, things of the same kind are all similar. Why would one have any doubt about this when it comes to humans alone? We and the sage are of the same kind. Hence, Longzi said, ‘When one makes a shoe for a foot one has not seen, we know that one will not make a basket.’ The similarity of all the shoes in the world is due to the fact that the feet of the world are the same. “Mouths have the same preferences in flavors. The master chef Yi Ya was the first to discover that which our mouths prefer. If it were the case that the natures of mouths regarding flavors varied among people—just as dogs and horses are different species from us—then why is it that throughout the world all preferences follow Yi Ya in flavors? The fact that, when it comes to flavors, the whole world looks to Yi Ya is due to the fact that mouths throughout the world are similar. “Ears are like this too. When it comes to sounds, the whole world looks to music master Shi Kuang. This is due to the fact that ears throughout the world are similar. Eyes are like this too. When it comes to a handsome man like Zidu, no one in the world does not appreciate his beauty. Anyone who does not appreciate the beauty of Zidu has no eyes. Hence, I say that mouths have the same preferences in flavors, ears have the same preferences in sounds, eyes have the same preferences in attractiveness. When it comes to hearts, are they alone without preferences in common? “What is it that hearts prefer in common? I say that it is fine patterns and righteousness. The sages first discovered what our hearts prefer in common. Hence, fine patterns and righteousness delight our hearts like meat delights our mouths.”"}

Could this be the nature of the mountain?! “When we consider what is present in people, could they truly lack the hearts of benevolence and righteousness?!

If it merely loses its nourishment, there is nothing that will not vanish. Kongzi said, ‘Grasped then preserved; abandoned then lost. Its goings and comings have no fixed time. No one knows its home.’ Was it not the heart of which he spoke?”"}

If I cannot have both, I will forsake fish and select bear’s paw. Life is something I desire; righteousness is also something I desire. If I cannot have both, I will forsake life and select righteousness. Life is something I desire, but there is something I desire more than life. Hence, I will not do just anything to obtain it. Death is something I hate, but there is something I hate more than death. Hence, there are calamities I do not avoid. If it were the case that someone desired nothing more than life, then what means that could obtain life would that person not use? If it were the case that someone hated nothing more than death, then what would that person not do that would avoid calamity? From this we can see that there are means of obtaining life that one will not employ. From this we can also see that there are things that would avoid calamity that one will not do. Therefore, there are things one desires more than life and there are also things one hates more than death. It is not the case that only the worthy person has this heart. All humans have it. The worthy person simply never loses it. “A basket of food and a bowl of soup—if one gets them then one will live; if one doesn’t get them then one will die. But if they’re given with contempt, then even a homeless person will not accept them. If they’re trampled upon, then even a beggar won’t take them. However, when it comes to a salary of ten thousand bushels of grain, then one doesn’t notice propriety and righteousness and accepts them. What do ten thousand bushels add to me? Do I accept them for the sake of a beautiful mansion? for the obedience of a wife and concubines? to have poor acquaintances be indebted to me? In the previous case, for the sake of one’s own life one did not accept what was offered. In the current case, for the sake of a beautiful mansion one does it.
