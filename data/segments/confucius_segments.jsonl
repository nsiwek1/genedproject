(See Analects 4. on these concepts.) Zigong’s aspiration to the virtue of shu is particularly amusing to Kongzi because Zigong is the most unimaginative and rigid of all the disciples. In Analects 5., for instance, his fastidious adherence to the rites leads Kongzi to dub him a “ritual vessel” of limited capacity, and in Analects 1. he is criticized by Kongzi for being too strict and judgmental with others (i.e., for not moderating his duty-defined demands upon others with understanding). Zigong thus functions in the Analects as an excellent example of how the virtue of loyalty goes awry when not tempered with sympathetic understanding, and this is perhaps why Kongzi singles out Zigong in Analects 1. for his message that “sympathetic understanding” is the one teaching that can serve as a lifelong guide. human nature or the Way of Heaven, but rather tried to focus his disciples’ attention upon the task at hand, acquiring the cultural refinement necessary to become gentlemen.

From earliest times, however, this book has been viewed by commentators as an extended description of the ritual behavior of Kongzi in particular, and it was in fact probably intended by the editors of the earliest stratum of the Analects (books 1–) to be understood that way. Seen as an actual description of the Master’s behavior rather than a set of impersonal ritual guidelines, book 1 serves as a sort of capstone for the first half of the Analects, providing a series of descriptions of the Master effortlessly embodying in his words, behavior, and countenance the lessons imparted throughout the rest of the text. What is being emphasized in this book is the ease and grace with which the Master embodies the spirit of the rites in every aspect of his life—no matter how trivial—and accords with this spirit in adapting to new and necessarily unforeseeable circumstances. response is both unexpected and moving.

What would you do?” Zengxi stopped strumming his zither, and as the last notes faded away, he set the instrument aside and rose to his feet. “I would choose to do something quite different from any of the other three.” “What harm is there in that?” the Master said. “We are all just talking about our aspirations.” Zengxi then said, “In the third month of Spring, once the Spring garments have been completed, I should like to assemble a company of five or six young men upon the individual needs of his students—a Confucian version of the Buddhist practice of upāya, or “skillful means.” On the distinctive characters of Ran Qiu and Zilu, compare Analects 6. and 9., respectively.KONGZI (CONFUCIUS)  and six or seven boys to go bathe in the Yi River and enjoy the breeze upon the Rain Dance Altar, and then return singing to the Master’s house.” The Master sighed deeply, saying, “I am with Zengxi!” The other three disciples left, but Master Zeng stayed behind.

The point is that true government is effected through the superior Virtue gained by ritual practice, and the task of the gentleman is thus to focus upon self-cultivation and attain a state of joyful harmony with the Way. Such harmony with the Way is exemplified by Zengxi’s musical bent, his reluctance to speak about his aspirations, and the sense of spontaneous joy in the cultivated life conveyed by his answer.

Sima Niu—apparently uninvolved in the revolt or its aftermath—resigned his official post in disgust and emigrated, ending up eventually in Lu, where he presumably had the conversation with Zixia recorded here. His comment that “he alone has no brothers” is thus not meant literally: the point is either that he has no brothers truly worthy of being considered brothers, or that all of his brothers are in exile or in constant danger of losing their lives and therefore as good as dead. Sima Niu is thus bemoaning the fate that has left him effectively without family, an exile from his home state. oceans.KONGZI (CONFUCIUS)  Zigong said, “If sacrificing one of these three things became unavoidable, which would you sacrifice first?” The Master replied, “I would sacrifice the armaments.” Zigong said, “If sacrificing one of the two remaining things became unavoidable, which would you sacrifice next?” The Master replied, “I would sacrifice the food.

Kongzi’s advice is thus very topical. His point is that if everyone would simply concentrate on conscientiously fulfilling their role-specific duties, order would result naturally—there is no need for some special technique or theory of “governing” (cf. Analects 2.).

Reading this passage in light of Analects 1. (“Let the lord be a true lord . . . the fathers true fathers, and the sons true sons.”), it can be seen as a barb against the ruling family of Wei, whose disordered family relations eventually threw the state into chaos. The Duke doted upon his notorious wife, Nanzi (see Analects 6.), whom his resentful son, Prince Kuai Kui, then attempted to kill. This attempt having failed, the son was forced to flee Wei, and the Duke’s grandson, Zhe, subsequently took over the throne upon the Duke’s death. Prince Kuai Kui then returned to Wei with the backing of a foreign army in an attempt to oust his son. CHAPTER ONE Zilu said, “Could you, Master, really be so far off the mark? Why worry about rectifying names?” The Master replied, “How boorish you are, Zilu! When it comes to matters that he does not understand, the gentleman should remain silent. If names are not rectified, speech will not accord [with reality]; when speech does not accord [with reality], things will not be successfully accomplished. When things are not successfully accomplished, ritual practice and music will fail to flourish; when ritual and music fail to flourish, punishments and penalties will miss the mark. And when punishments and penalties miss the mark, the common people will be at a loss as to what to do with themselves.
