Once ruler and ministers chase gain, families and commoners will wrestle for advantage and the state will fall into peril. Speak instead of benevolence and righteousness—those who are filial never abandon their parents, and those who uphold righteousness never betray their ruler. Plant those standards and the realm endures."}]}

That very heart of compassion is sufficient for kingship, provided you extend it to the people. Strength enough to lift five hundred pounds but not a feather is merely unused strength; the same goes for benevolence that reaches beasts but not your subjects."}]}

The former kings felt this and therefore governed humanely. When anyone suddenly sees a child about to fall into a well, they instinctively feel alarm and compassion—not to curry favor or fame, but because such sprouts are planted by Heaven. Nourish them and goodness will grow."}]}
